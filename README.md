# The [DST-2](https://github.com/TudorSupica/DST-2/)
![isometric](https://github.com/TudorSupica/DST-2/blob/main/PCB/3D/3D_iso.JPG)

   The DST-2 is the second version of the DST distortion pedal series. It's main goal was to make the pedal a whole lot modular and easier to debug, since I want all the future pedals to be compatible with one another. 
  
  The modularity comes from the use of JST connectors and the use of modules like the ![TMC-1](https://github.com/TudorSupica/TMC-1) and the [TMF](https://github.com/TudorSupica/TMF). These modules aim to standardise the pedal-making process and to make all the future pedals compatible.

  The debugging aspect of the board comes from the use of test pads labled accordingly, so that when eventually a problem arises, they can be debugged and fixed. The test pads I added mainly target features like power supply and signal line. I also connected the four screw holes found in the corners of the board to GND, so that when debigging I won't have to actively look for a GND test point.

  Another feature that I introduced with this board is the use of SMD components rather than THT ones (except for like, a couple diodes and the transistors). This change aimed to minimize the board size, to ensure it is going to fit alongside the other modules in the metal enclosure.

  # [The Schematic](https://github.com/TudorSupica/DST-2/blob/main/Schematic/)
   The schematic is made up of a few blocks: a buffer stage, initial amplifying stage, a variable gain stage, clipping stage, filtering stage and a final buffer stage. 

   ### The buffer stage 
   The buffer stage is a voltage follower made up of the transistor *Q1* and *R1*, *R2* and *C1*, *C2*.
   
   This stage has a voltage gain of (*ideally*) 1, so that the voltage at the collector of *Q1* is exactly the signal but 180ยบ out of phase (*basically the signal but inverted, lmao maths*). But the real advantage of the buffer stage comes from the high-impedance input and low-impedance output of the stage. 
  
   The resistor *R1* biases the transistor whilst the resistor *R2* provides thermal stability (*you **could** add another capacitor in parallel with R2, so that it shorts at higher frequencies providing better stability thus a better frequency responce*). The capacitors *C1* and *C2* are decoupling capacitors, they eliminate the DC characteristic of the signal so that I can bias it however I need to (*again, lmao maths*).

   ### The initial amplifying stage
   The initial amplifying stage is made up of the transistor *Q2*, the resistors *R3* thru *R6* and the capacitors *C3* thru *C5*.

   The resistor *R3* and capacitor *C3* make up a high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of about 33 Hz. The capacitor *C3* is also used to decouple the signal, and the resistor *R4* is used to bias the base signal of the transistor *Q2*.

   The resistor *R5* and the capacitor *C4* make up the feedback loop of the stage, whilst the resistor *R6* gives the amplifying ratio of the stage (*its ratio is roughly R6/internal resistance of the BE junction*).

   And finally the capacitor *C5* is used to decouple the signal before it reaches the next stage.

   ### The variable gain stage
   The variable gain stage is made up of a few components, mainly a double op-amp DIP-8 IC (*even tho the TL072 or the LM358 work fine, I'd strongly recommend some better op-amps such as the OPA2134*) with some support components such as resistors and capacitors.
